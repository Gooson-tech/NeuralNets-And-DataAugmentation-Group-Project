# ***Using augmentation methods on audio files to increase the size of limited datasets.***

  Small datasets can be plagued with the issue of producing models that present poor accuracy.  Sometimes there is just not enough information to get a network to learn without drastic overfitting.  So you have a small dataset and you are having issues training a network with decent accuracy? Well do we have a cure for you: data augmentation.
### What's in the repository?
  Here you will find a some resources and an easy-to-follow (sort-of) demonstation on how data augmentation can improve your accuracy.
  1. A free dataset of audio samples recored as .wav files
  2. Documentation on how you can perform augmenetations on the audio samples.  If you just want to get to the good stuff, feel free to use our augmented dataset located in the Data section.
  3. The code to transform the .wav files into spectrogram images for use in a neural network.  Don't have the time?  We've got you!  A full set of images are housed in the Data section as well.
  4. A pre-built network designed to test out out your handi-work (or ours if you just want to see the end result).
  5. You will also find some interesting links and documentation all related to this topic.
### Ready to take a look?
Go ahead and open the demo above.  You will need a few things installed to make this work.  Not to worry, we will walk you through it!
