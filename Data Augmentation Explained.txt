Data augmentation is the act of taking a small group of data and using the samples within that set to create more samples. In the scope of our project, data augmentation takes the form of changing our audio samples by means of pitch shifting, time stretching, and time compressing. Pitch is the more common term for the "frequency" of a soundwave, or, more scientifically, how fast a soundwave modulates between compression (not associated with time compression) and rarefaction. The higher or lower the frequency, the higher or lower the pitch of the sound, respectively. In this case, we have taken the original sound files and either increased or decreased the frequency by set intervals. Our next two processes, time stretching and compressing, both go hand in hand, in which stretching is the elongating of the original sample and compressing is the shortening of said sample. It is worth noting that in some instances, if a pitch shift is done, the program completes the process by performing a time stretch or compression, and the reverse holds true as well. However, certain programs are designed to construct the modified audio in a way that makes these two processes independent of each other, which is what WavAugment does, allowing us to control pitch and time by their own values. After the processes have completed, each new sample that has been made is added to a new batch along with their original versions, thus creating a much larger data set than we originally started with.
